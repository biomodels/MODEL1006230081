# Model Notes


This a model from the article:  
**Modeling defective interfering virus therapy for AIDS: conditions for DIV survival.**   
Nelson GW, Perelson AS. _Math Biosci_ 1995 Feb;125(2):127-53
[7881191](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7881191) ,  
**Abstract:**   
The administration of a genetically engineered defective interfering virus
(DIV) that interferes with HIV-1 replication has been proposed as a therapy
for HIV-1 infection and AIDS. The proposed interfering virus, which is
designed to superinfect HIV-1 infected cells, carries ribozymes that cleave
conserved regions in HIV-1 RNA that code for the viral envelope protein. Thus
DIV infection of HIV-1 infected cells should reduce or eliminate viral
production by these cells. The success of this therapeutic strategy will
depend both on the intercellular interaction of DIV and HIV-1, and on the
overall dynamics of virus and T cells in the body. To study these dynamical
issues, we have constructed a mathematical model of the interaction of HIV-1,
DIV, and CD4+ cells in vivo. The results of both mathematical analysis and
numerical simulation indicate that survival of the engineered DIV purely on a
peripheral blood HIV-1 infection is unlikely. However, analytical results
indicate that DIV might well survive on HIV-1 infected CD4+ cells in lymphoid
organs such as lymph nodes and spleen, or on other HIV-1 infected cells in
these organs.
